  "website_title": "Water Reuse Drivers Index",
  "description": "This index uses carefully-selected data sources to illustrate which water systems in the United States are experiencing conditions that could make water reuse implementation more beneficial if feasible (i.e. drivers). Note that alternative water source availability and the ability to capture it near where it's needed are not included in this index, only the presence and intensity of water reuse drivers. This resource is based on The Water Research Foundation (WRF) project 5197, funded under Grant No. 84046201 awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to WRF. The research team thank WRF and EPA for their support of this project. This resource has not been formally reviewed by WRF or EPA. The views expressed in this resource are solely those of authors and do not necessarily reflect those of WRF or EPA. We would also like to thank the University of Washington's eScience Institute and the students in the Data Science for Social Good Program for their hard work developing the Index user interface.",
